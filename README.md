#TE 566 Accounting Software
Created by Muhammad Rizky Wellyanto 

Project is live at https://te-566-acctg-app.herokuapp.com/

## Setup manual
- make sure you have npm, nodejs
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start`
- go to http://localhost:3000/

## Notes
- if you have any problem running this app, feel free to contact me at wellyan2@illinois.edu
- DO NOT REFRESH THE PAGE. Due to the scope of the assignment, I don't have time to use a database. So any progress is saved in browser memory, and will be erased if you try a new session.
- I will turn off the demo server by Dec 31 2018
- The source code is available here: https://github.com/RizkyWellyanto/accounting-app
